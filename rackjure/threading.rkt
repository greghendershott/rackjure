;; Originally this had its own implementation. Now we use depend on
;; the `threading` package and re-provide all of it, plus rename its
;; and~> to some~> for backward compatibility.
;;
;; Preserving this module and doing the re-provide here, for programs
;; that (require rackjure/threading).
;;
;; Preserving some of the original tests to ensure compatability
;; during the transition and going forward. (The tests that checked
;; using expand-once needed to be changed because the threading
;; package implementation's intermediate expansion steps aren't not
;; necessarily the same -- but the fully-expanded forms should be.)
